Use HeadphoneCal program to obtain magnitude and phase response 
(as function of frequency) of, typically, loudspeakers.

Typically, a *_frdata.mat file is needed from the MicrophoneCal 
program, although an "assumed" flat microphone may also be used.  In
the latter case, a conversion factor to convert from Volts to Pascal
will be needed if the calibration data will be used to generate 
pre-calibrated stimuli.
