The NICal Matlab program is used to obtain magnitude and phase response 
(as function of frequency) of, typically, loudspeakers.  It should also
be able to calibrate earphones using in situ microphones, but this 
has not been tested.  It is a relative of the HeadphoneCal program, also
part of the TytoLogy project.

It was written to use the NI-DAQ boards with the Matlab Data Acquisition 
Toolbox.  Other hardware could be used, but appropriate changes to the 
input/output functions and setup would be necessary.
